# Football-Rankings Project Roadmap 



1. ### Done 11/8 - Find additional code repositories with additional examples of what might work for our project

2.[x] 11/11 - Finalize decisions on structure of the program and what ideas to compile 

3.[x] 11/15 - Jacob: Test Betting.py, Conference.py, Constants.py, Dates.py and Game.py and deposit the files

4.[x] 11/15 - JT: Upload and test Ranking.py, ranking.txt, SimGame.py, Team.py. Make commits.

5.[ ] 11/17 - JT: Integrate files and ensure they all work together as intended. This would include making sure the programs complete 
scraping the current football rankings. 

6.[ ] 11/19 - JT: Research potential open-source programs on GitHub that could take the rankings out of their file and put them in an excel file. Collect possible 

7.[ ] 11/19 - Jacob: Research potential open-source programs on GitHub that could take the rankings out of either their file or the excel sheet and run statistics on them. For example, this could be a program that takes the stats of each team and projects the best/worst match ups coming up. 

8.[ ] 11/22 - Jacob: Test the new code found and have a meeting with JT to decide the best course of action with the found code. 

9.[ ] 11/22 - JT: Test the code to bring the rankings file into an excel spreadsheet and meet with Jacob to decide the best course of action with the found code. 

10.[ ] 11/24(Break) - Jacob: Integrate new code found with original rankings code and make adjustments to our particular goals. Also, explore new possiblities.  

11.[ ] 11/24(Break) - JT: Explore new possiblities and troubleshoot the integration of the original rankings code with the new code. 

12.[ ] 11/28(Break) - Jacob: Final troubleshooting of the project with code optimization. Final problems and errors should be solved by the end of this process. 

13.[ ] 11/28(Break) - JT: Final troubleshooting of the project with code optimization with Jacob. FInal problems should be solved.

14.[ ] 11/30 - Jacob: Prepare a powerpoint presentation detailing our thought process and decision making throughout the development of our application. 

15.[ ] 11/30 - JT: Final check ensuring the application is running properly for the presentaion. If it is not running properly and we cannot fix the error, we will present possible solutions to the error and where we went wrong.
