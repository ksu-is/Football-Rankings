# Football-Rankings Project Roadmap 



### 1.Done 11/8 - Find additional code repositories with additional examples of what might work for our project.

### 2.Done 11/11 - Finalize decisions on structure of the program and what ideas to compile 

### 3.Done 11/15 - Jacob: Test Betting.py, Conference.py, Constants.py, Dates.py and Game.py and deposit the files

### 4.Done 11/15 - JT: Upload and test Ranking.py, ranking.txt, SimGame.py, Team.py. Make commits.

### 5.11/17 - JT: Integrate files and ensure they all work together as intended. This would include making sure the programs complete scraping the current football rankings. Afterwards, the base code should be running properly. 

### 6.11/19 - JT: Research potential open-source programs on GitHub that could take the rankings out of their file and put them in an excel file. Collect possible code repositories and prepare them for the meeting. There should be at least 2 viable open source code repositories for the meeting.

### 7.  11/19 - Jacob: Research potential open-source programs on GitHub that could take the rankings out of either their file or the excel sheet and run statistics on them. For example, this could be a program that takes the stats of each team and projects the best/worst match ups coming up. There should be at least 2 viable open source code repositories for the meeting.

### 8.11/22 - Jacob: Test the new code found and have a meeting with JT to decide the best course of action with the found code. By the end of this meeting we should both be on the same page about how we are going forward with the project and have additions to our originally found code. 

### 9. 11/22 - JT: Test the code to bring the rankings file into an excel spreadsheet and meet with Jacob to decide the best course of action with the found code. Afterwards, there should be one integrated project either running or not running with a back up repository that could be used.

### 10. 11/24(Break) - Jacob: Integrate new code found with original rankings code and make adjustments to our particular goals. Also, explore new possiblities and additions to our application. Afterwards, our original code should be integrated and running with our new code and we should evaluate whether to explore the statistics ideas further or optimize what we currently have.  

### 11. 11/24(Break) - JT: Explore new possiblities and troubleshoot the integration of the original rankings code with the new code. Afterwards, our original code should be integrated and running with our new code and we should evaluate whether to explore the statistics ideas further or optimize what we currently have.  
 

### 12. 11/28(Break) - Jacob: Final troubleshooting of the project with code optimization. Final problems and errors should be solved by the end of this process. 

### 13. 11/28(Break) - JT: Final troubleshooting of the project with code optimization with Jacob. FInal problems should be solved by the end of this process. 

### 14. 11/30 - Jacob: Prepare a powerpoint presentation detailing our thought process and decision making throughout the development of our application. Afterwards there should be a completed presenation prepared for presentation day. 

### 15. 11/30 - JT: Final check ensuring the application is running properly for the presentaion. If it is not running properly and we cannot fix the error, we will present possible solutions to the error and where we went wrong. Afterwards we should know exactly how our application will run and how our presentation will go.
